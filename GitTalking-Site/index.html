  <!-- What is GitTalking -->
  <h2> What is GitTalking? </h2>
  <p> Welcome to GitTalking! This site embodies (or at least it will!) the unique fusion of the technical collaboration of GitHub, and the social interaction of
	   Facebook. This site is intended to be an informal, yet effective way for programmers to work together and communicate with each other. With this 
       site, we seek to bring users everything they need to work together on common projects, and provide feedback to each other's work in a usefully enjoyable
       setting.	</p>
  <br>
  <!-- Why use GitTalking? -->
  <h2> Why Should I Use GitTalking? </h2>
  <p> GitTalking allows one to experience all the social interaction and collaborative work on programming projects in one centralized location. There's no need
      to switch back and forth between dozens of tabs. You can submit your contributions to the work you need to do, and communicate with your team members all
	  in the same spot! GitTalking allows teammates to provide feedback on their friends' work, and keep in touch at the same time, with the same easy-to-use
	  interface. Best of all--it's free!
  </p>
